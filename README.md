# diffusion

My own code for implementing diffusion based models from these papers:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09672.pdf

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05233.pdf

Currently, only the first paper is implemented, mostly.

MNIST almost works:

Some of the digits are way too thick, some are way too thin. Otherwise it seems to be working well.
